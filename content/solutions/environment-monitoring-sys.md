Server and switch need certain operating environmental conditions, once environment crossed normal threshold, equipment fault generated, typical influence factors:
<ol class='pt-2 pl-6 leading-relaxed list-decimal'>
  <li class='pl-1'>Power: (Unstable mains supply and 3-phase power; Distribution switch fault; Lighting etc.)</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Environment: (High Temp. and Humi., Water leakage, Insufficient ventilation, Low air pressure, etc.)</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Security: (Intrusion, door access control, Glass breaker, Fire, Smoke etc.)</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Intelligent equipment: (UPS and Precision air condition fault etc.)</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Extension: (Humidifier, Dehumidifier and Ventilation system fault etc.)</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Network :(Server crash or stop, Network interrupt etc.)</li>
</ol>

<br>

Environmental factors cross operating threshold or lack of supervision and management, resulting in following troubles:
<ol class='pt-2 pl-6 leading-relaxed list-decimal'>
  <li class='pl-1'>Slow system running speed or stop, server crash</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Data center equipment damaged or lost</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Power failure</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Disk read and write failed, CPU error</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Network connection failure or hacked</li>
</ol>

For the problems existing in small and medium-sized data centers and the characteristics of wide distribution of data centers and monitoring contents, DATIS provides a complete solution to help users to realize centralized monitoring and centralized management.

<br>

<ul class='pt-2 pl-6 leading-relaxed list-disc'>
  <li class='pl-1'>Video cameras: Capture moving images of gate, aisle and cabinet from data centers.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Intrusion: Door contact, Microware/infrared radiation, Glass breaker, Detect break-in and artificial destruction.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Environment: Monitor humiture changes and water leak, control ventilation System and air condition automatically.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Power: Monitor mains, UPS, SPD and power supply state, lightning protection</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Fire protection: Open flames, smoke and heat detector, etc.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Access control: Field or remote control access of data centers, authorize and manage personnel access.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Server and network: CPU and memory usage, network state</li>
</ul>

<br>

DATIS environment monitoring system uses centralized monitoring. Besides front-end data processing, monitoring center also provides management function that designed for users, such as user login, assigning permissions, coordination of control signal, real-time monitoring, data storage, statistics and analysis, environment intelligent management.

<h6 class='pb-2'>Integrated design, comprehensive monitoring</h6>

DATIS put video surveillance , access control , security , environmental systems into the power environment monitoring host, to provide you with centralized monitoring, display, alarm, unified management services.

<br>

DATIS can centrally monitor sites distributed throughout. Install DMView in the management center, and IDs are assigned to the monitoring and management machines in each data center, then all the data centers can be centralized monitoring and remote controlled.

<br>

<h6 class='pb-2'>Instant alarm, intelligent management</h6>

DATIS provides SMS, phone, email, sound and light, mobile phones, multimedia voice and other alarm methods, please choose a most suitable for your alarm.

<br>

In addition to providing you with real-time alarms, DATIS also provides you with an intelligent processing mechanism. You can customize the setting of alarm handling. For example, you can set the upper temperature alarm limit, automatically turn on the air condition for the data center cooling, after data center temperature decreases, the air condition will be automatically shut down.

<br>

In addition to the intelligent processing mechanism,DATIS also provides you with remote control function.You can freeze, unfreeze, open, close, view or do other operations anytime, anywhere through SMS, mobile phone and PC to the equipment in the data center.

<br>

DATIS can also provides you data statistics,analyze, predict functions, and send you daily data center operations by SMS or email.

<br>

<h6 class='pb-2'>Safe and Stable</h6>

DATIS monitoring host adopts low power ARM chip, the whole machine power consumption is less than 5W; Using Linux operating system, with high reliability, good stability, no hard disk design,you don't need to worry about Trojan horse, virus infection, auxiliary heat dissipation; With built-in hardware and software double watchdog and automatic fault recovery function, It will never crash.

<br>

DATIS monitoring host comes with storage media, can work independently off-line; With the local cache, It will resume after the network recovery.

<br>

DATIS products support the upload of collected data to multiple monitoring centers. And it supports dual hot standby, when the host is abnormal, it will automatically switch to standby to work.

<br>

<h6 class='pb-2'>Support multiple protocols and monitor wide range.</h6>

DATIS products support sensors for Modbus, SNMP and IO protocols:

<ul class='pt-2 pl-6 leading-relaxed list-disc'>
  <li class='pl-1'>Switch sensors: infrared, smoke, water leakage, glass break etc.</li>
  <li class='pl-1'>Digital sensors: temperature and humidity, air condition controller, single-phase power meter, three-phase power
meter etc.</li>
