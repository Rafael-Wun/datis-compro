<h5 class='pb-2'>DATIS Monitoring System</h5>

DATIS has two model monitoring hosts, which can meet the needs of small and medium-sized data centers and stations of different sizes. When environmental parameters are too high or alarm is issued, DATIS hosts can use sound and light, SMS, e-mail, phone to alarm and inform the data center manager in time to ensure the safe and stable operation of the data center network equipment.
